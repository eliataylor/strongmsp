My app is a pickup sports community organizer where users can organize and join pick games in any sport.
Merge the UserProfile under User and consider that Registrations can be approved or declined by the Game organizer. Also set a capacity to each game.
"Introduce the concept of 2 more teams for every Game and that game registrations can designate a team or not, but once approved that user is assigned to the team."
Make Teams an content type and allow a Game to have any number of them.
Game should a reference to Team and could replace the Team.game field and the GameTeams reference table . Also flesh out the fields for a Team with branding fields, stats, but create a reference table for Teams-Players to allow many-to-many relationships with field positions.
My app is a recipe generator based on what people have in their fridge.
For the UserFridge, the quantity needs a unit, and dates for last stocked, expiration, and optional references to a receipt for tracking spending and projecting costs.

Merge Profile under User, allow multiple Hosts for an Event and expand on the Invitation features for including messages, allowed guests and RSVPs that respond to that.

Allow Notes on the Spreadsheet level and Collaborators on the Project level.
Make an Owner optional

This works. Please validate and schema.
A location should be able to have multiple fields of any field type.
"The Relationship field always needs to name a Model defined in the Schema, not just say ""Foreign Key""."
Always validate the schema and return it in the stream.
